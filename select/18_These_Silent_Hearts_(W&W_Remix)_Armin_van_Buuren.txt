All the sounds begin to rush in
And further alter our perception
The silence that we keep in this sleep
Is rising from its slumber again
What we see we find is intertwined
With our beliefs, manifesting in daily life
It all feels pure and simple now

These silent hearts
We hold within our hands
Within my heart
The rush is just the same
These silent hearts
Protected from the dark
Let silence be broken

These silent hearts
We hold within our hands
Within my heart
The rush is just the same
These silent hearts
Protected from the dark
And let silence be broken

These silent hearts
These silent hearts
These silent hearts

These silent hearts
We hold within our hands
Within my heart
The rush is just the same
These silent hearts
Protected from the dark
And let silence be broken
