Nobody here knocking at my door
The sound of silence I can't take anymore
Nobody ringing my telephone now
Oh how I miss such a beautiful sound

And I don't even know how I survive
I won't make it to the shore without your light
No I don't even know if I'm alive
Whoa, without you now

This is what it feels like
Nothing to hold on but the memories and frame
Oh, they remind me of the battle I face
Without your love, without you I drown

Somebody save me, I'm going down
And I don't even know how I survive
I won't make it to the shore without your light
No I don't even know if I'm alive
Whoa, without you now
This is what it feels like
And I don't even know how I survive
I won't make it to the shore without your light
No I don't even know if I'm alive
Whoa, without you now
This is what it feels like
